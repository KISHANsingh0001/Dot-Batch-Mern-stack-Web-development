<!-- H.W. - difference between the header tag and h1 tag ??
    The <header> tag is used to define a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links. It typically includes a logo or site title, and sometimes the main navigation menu.

The <h1> tag, on the other hand, is used to define a heading. It is used to indicate the most important heading on a page, and typically contains the main topic of the page. It is one of six heading levels (h1-h6) that can be used to indicate the hierarchy of headings on a page.

In summary, the <header> tag is used to define a container for introductory content and navigation, while the <h1> tag is used to define the main heading of a page. The <header> tag can include other elements like <nav> and <h1> as well as other headings.

   H.W- Can we use header tag in footer tag
    Yes, technically you can use a <header> tag inside a <footer> tag in HTML, but it would be semantically confusing and not typically recommended.

    The <header> tag is meant to contain introductory content or navigational elements at the beginning of a page or section, while the <footer> tag is meant to contain information about the containing element, such as authorship information, copyright notices, contact information, or links to related documents.

<!--  H.W. Can we use the multiple header tag in single web page ??
 
  Yes, you can use multiple <header> tags in a single web page. In HTML5, the <header> tag is a semantic element that can be used to define introductory content or navigation links at the beginning of different sections of the   page.

  Using multiple <header> tags allows you to organize and structure your page's content more effectively.
